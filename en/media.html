Many of these stories lack authenticity, transparency, or are driven by ulterior motives which serve a predetermined narrative. These are just some of the few obstacles that get in the way of honest, wholesome and dignified storytelling within development and humanitarian contexts. In order for a piece - be it visual, written or spoken - to reach an audience, it goes through a long process of filtration, revising and editing that sometimes alters the original content and makes it almost fictional. This in turn, ends up painting the wrong picture of the contributors who oftentimes are not aware of where their stories, visual or written, will be displayed and to what purpose will they be used.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDignified Storytelling was born out of the need to unite the voices of content makers, editors, journalists, photographers, filmmakers, storytellers, and contributors and equip them with the awareness and hands-on knowledge that will enable them to capture moments and tell stories without compromising human dignity. In order to fulfill this need, Dignified Storytelling kickstarted global consultations a year ago, to solicit cross-sectoral perspectives on storytelling within development and humanitarian contexts, as well as set and agree on the Dignified Storytelling Principles that today serve as guidance and an advocacy tool for bringing together various stakeholders from around the world to form a global movement that will be a game changer in maintaining and promoting human dignity through storytelling. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThese foundational principles are also guiding the consultative development of an accessible and practical Dignified Storytelling Handbook which provides ‘how-to’ guidance and concrete best practice case studies. Cross-sectoral perspectives and insights from a diverse group of storytellers and experienced stakeholders from governments, UN agencies, international and local NGOs, and civil society are currently informing this valuable framework and resource.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTo truly embed Dignified Storytelling in the day-to-day policies and practices among international development agencies and various storytellers within the development and humanitarian sectors, Dubai Cares, Expo 2020 Dubai and UAE MoFAIC have established a Dignified Storytelling Alliance. The Alliance is a network of champions that provides advocacy, in-kind support, and input on program deliverables. Representation in the Alliance includes a deliberately diverse range of viewpoints from organizations, individuals and governments who are able to share best practices from their on-the-ground experiences within a range of development contexts.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHer Excellency Reem Al Hashimy, UAE Minister of State for International Cooperation and Director General, Expo 2020 Dubai, remarked: “At a time when it is needed most, Expo 2020 will bring the world together in a spirit of hope and optimism, building bridges and inspiring action towards a brighter future for us all. This will be the ideal setting for strengthening Dignified Storytelling as we join our resources to reinforce the highest standards and increase the impact of those stories we choose to share with the world. The initiative also reflects the UAE’s commitment to advancing responsible storytelling for the greater good of humankind, and its central role in international humanitarian and development efforts more widely.” \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eStressing on the importance of storytelling in the development context, Dr. Tariq Al Gurg, Chief Executive Officer at Dubai Cares and Member of its Board of Directors, said: “Storytelling is a powerful communication tool in both development and humanitarian settings. Stories, both visual and written, provide an avenue for understanding different perspectives and can be an impetus for action. This is why it is important for us as a global community to tackle irresponsible storytelling, a practice that has been left unaddressed for far too long, which I believe is rooted in the absence of widely available and comprehensive guidance on how to best tell stories that maintain the dignity of all persons. I invite all storytellers, governments, agencies, and civil society to join us in this effort to instill an understanding and practice of storytelling that brings us together and reminds us of our shared humanity.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe initiative will include the Dignified Storytelling Forum, taking place at Expo 2020 Dubai on 10 December 2021 as part of the six-month mega-event. The Forum will serve as a powerful platform for key stakeholders – including members of civil society organizations, governments, the private sector, and international agencies as well as advocates, activists, and storytellers – to come together and collectively agree on a way forward in validating, adopting and integrating the Dignified Storytelling Principles. This will be achieved through a series of plenaries and an exhibition showcasing best practices in Dignified Storytelling, as well as side events including a press conference. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe Forum is part of Expo 2020’s rich calendar of specialist programming, which reflects and celebrates the spirit of Dignified Storytelling all throughout. Encompassing cultural, social, economic, environmental and UAE-based themes, the program series has been curated in close collaboration with UAE entities, International Participants, Non-Official Participants, International Organisations and Commercial Partners and and seeks to garner solidarity around global challenges, spotlight areas of mutual interest and importance, and ensure the emergence of a meaningful legacy at the national, regional and international level.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOver the longer-term, Dignified Storytelling will create an environment of positivity that strengthens long-term relationships between the public, private, development and humanitarian sectors by placing dignified and ethical storytelling at the epicenter of knowledge sharing, stakeholder engagement, and capacity development to inspire and inform storytellers. To achieve this, the UAE calls on global stakeholders and partners to become advocates for this pivotal initiative by pledging towards the ten principles of Dignified Storytelling.\u003c/p\u003e","CulturePrefix":"en","Summary":"","Url":"uae-calls-on-the-global-community-to-join-efforts-to-instill-and-maintain-human-dignity-through-storytelling","FormattedDate":"25 May 2021","VideoUrl":"","Date":"\/Date(1621886400000)\/","DetailImages":[],"ThumbnailImage":{"Url":"https://www.almaktouminitiatives.org/images/default-source/banners/ds-guatemala41729eed-925b-4db6-990f-ce4eaa778c17.jpeg?sfvrsn=9ee794a_3","AlternativeText":""}},{"Id":"00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000","TypeId":"00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000","Title":"100 Million Meals campaign concludes with a whopping 216 million meals","Text":"\u003cp\u003eHis Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice President and Prime Minister of the UAE and Ruler of Dubai, announced that the UAE’s Ramadan campaign has secured 216 million meals, more than double its target, for vulnerable groups in 30 countries across four continents. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‘100 Million Meals’ campaign, the region’s biggest food distribution drive, concluded on Saturday after drawing massive donations from 385,000 individuals, companies, businessmen and philanthropists across 51 countries through various donation channels and two charity auctions. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFunds raised will help distribute food parcels, equivalent to 216 million meals, to people in need across the Middle East, Africa, Asia, Europe and South America. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLow-income families, orphans, widows and parents of refugee children in several countries have already started preparing their own nutritious meals during the holy month of Ramadan as distribution of food parcels began in cooperation with local and international partners.\u0026nbsp; \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDistribution of food parcels, carrying essential easy-to-store food items, will continue over the next three months to reach beneficiaries in the 30 targeted countries.

However, while new-age technology has unlocked a whole new world of opportunities for global industries, our education system has not made any real progress in terms of effectively utilizing the opportunities presented by this new dynamic. As the world continues to grapple with the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on livelihoods, health and the future, we believe that the time has come for a major disruption in the education space. This will be done through a complete overhaul of the entire ecosystem that will combine the power of technological advancement with the infinite strength of human skills, vision and connection, which we firmly believe, is the centerpiece of the human progress and development story.

The recently launched African Union Biennial Report on Home-Grown School Feeding (2019-2020) is a key deliverable of this project and has been produced with support of all Cluster members. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe work of WFP and Dubai Cares over the last ten years has contributed to a sea-change in how the world views the roles of health and education in the creation of human capital. The COVID-19 crisis has had a huge impact on school children. Nearly 1.6 billion children and youth – or more than 90 percent of enrolled students around the world – are out of school and universities due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Due to the pandemic, nearly 370 million schoolchildren are now without school meals on which they depend, 65 million of these children live in Africa. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe effects on these children and their families are dire. For many hungry children, a school meal may be their only nutritious meal during the day. For poor families, the value of a meal in school is equivalent to about 10 percent of a household’s monthly income. This is an economic burden that comes on top of potential earning and employment loss during this pandemic.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWFP will work closely with Dubai Cares and the African Union on this multi-sectoral project to jointly ensure that all primary schoolchildren in Africa have access to good quality meals in school, accompanied by a broader integrated package of health and nutrition services.\u003c/p\u003e","CulturePrefix":"en","Summary":"","Url":"the-un-world-food-programme-and-dubai-cares-partner-to-jointly-invest-in-health-and-nutrition-of-school-children-in-africa","FormattedDate":"16 March 2021","VideoUrl":"","Date":"\/Date(1615838400000)\/","DetailImages":[],"ThumbnailImage":{"Url":"https://www.almaktouminitiatives.org/images/default-source/years-in-review-images/image-21b37f57a-3437-4fad-9106-18b8037515d7.jpg?sfvrsn=1344cf9a_3","AlternativeText":""}},{"Id":"00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000","TypeId":"00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000","Title":"Madrasa launches ‘Future Sciences for Children’ Series","Text":"\u003cp\u003eAs part of the UAE Innovates 2021, Madrasa eLearning platform launched a new educational series that introduces students to future science fields in engaging and simplified Arabized high-tech videos.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe ‘Future Sciences for Children’ video series covers 10 main fields including space, aviation, medicine, energy, environment, modern architecture, and advanced technologies.

These educational materials, as well as permanent pedagogical innovations developed according to the national curriculum, will be freely accessible on mobile and desktop devices.

This program is a collaboration between the Jordanian Ministry of Education and Community Jameel and Dubai Cares.

Over a period of 5 years, the AED 20.2 million (USD 5.5 million) TREE program - which includes an AED 5,510,250 (USD 1,500,000) contribution from Dubai Cares - involves teachers, head teachers and government representatives with the program team to develop and refine an iterative process that focuses on two core areas to improve TPD in Jordan. The program also aims to improve teachers’ wellbeing by capitalizing on the partners’ experience to bring compassion and empathy into education-based thinking. Furthermore, the program seeks to improve quality of teaching through a blended learning approach for teacher development, which takes into consideration the wellbeing of children, identification of their competencies and monitoring of their development. This pilot program, which is set to benefit 1,350 teachers and impact 745,000 people in Jordan, will be up-scalable to help millions of children in crisis situations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCommenting on the significance of this program, Dr. Al Gurg said: “Teachers in some parts of Jordan are struggling in extremely challenging environments such as inadequate support, overcrowded classrooms, and lack of training, to name a few.

This pilot program relies heavily on Pedago’s proprietary and innovative learning solution. The company is developing the necessary instructional courses, which are optimized for smartphones given the high device penetration across Jordan. The concept of MiyaMiya was conceived as a digital curriculum delivery solution targeting refugee children and youth but will eventually be made available to all learners.

Not attending secondary education prevents students from passing the final exam ‘\u003cem\u003eTawjihi’\u003c/em\u003e and receiving the necessary school certification to gain access to the job market, or study further. The success rate for passing the ‘\u003cem\u003eTawjihi’\u003c/em\u003e is only 32% among Syrian refugee youth and 40% among Jordanian youth, thus underlining the overall strain on teachers and the lack of investments in pedagogical capacity for decades.\u003c/p\u003e","CulturePrefix":"en","Summary":"","Url":"dubai-cares-launches-a-portfolio-of-groundbreaking-programs-to-support-eccd-primary-and-secondary-education-in-jordan","FormattedDate":"17 February 2020","VideoUrl":"","Date":"\/Date(1581883200000)\/","DetailImages":[{"Url":"https://www.almaktouminitiatives.org/images/default-source/default-album/6d2a0600.jpg?sfvrsn=b3fd263c_3","AlternativeText":""},{"Url":"https://www.almaktouminitiatives.org/images/default-source/default-album/6d2a0859.jpg?sfvrsn=1b5c0172_2","AlternativeText":""},{"Url":"https://www.almaktouminitiatives.org/images/default-source/default-album/4h7a9926.jpg?sfvrsn=42a421a3_2","AlternativeText":""},{"Url":"https://www.almaktouminitiatives.org/images/default-source/default-album/4h7a8879.jpg?sfvrsn=e9f46341_2","AlternativeText":""}],"ThumbnailImage":{"Url":"https://www.almaktouminitiatives.org/images/default-source/default-album/6d2a0600.jpg?sfvrsn=b3fd263c_3","AlternativeText":""}},{"Id":"00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000","TypeId":"00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000","Title":"UAE community takes millions of steps in solidarity with children who walk long distances to reach school in developing countries","Text":"\u003cp\u003eDubai Cares, part of Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum Global Initiatives; today (Friday February 14, 2020) welcomed thousands from the UAE community who walked 3 kilometers in solidarity with millions of children who must cover the same distance every day simply to go to school.

To tackle these issues, research is instrumental in finding effective and sustainable solutions to respond to these challenges. Research also drills down into the challenges that education faces in situations of emergencies, and consequently help us to generate evidence for effective preparedness and timely response strategies.

The country, with an estimated population of 32.5 million, managed to reduce poverty levels significantly between 2006 and 2012 thanks to the surge of its mineral exports, but the trend has stalled in recent years. Children in the rural areas of the country are the most affected as they represent 60% of the population living in poverty. Rural areas are penalized due to only 53% of the population having access to drinking water, much lower than in the capital (83%). Between 2002 and 2013, Peru was one of the fastest-growing countries in Latin America, with an average GDP growth rate of 6.1 percent annually. However, the GDP growth slowed to an average rate of 3.0 percent between 2014 and 2017 and raised to 3.7% in 2018. The benefits in the country are not equally redistributed within the society and inequalities keep widening between the large cities and rural areas, where only 44.6% of students finish high school.","CulturePrefix":"en","Summary":"","Url":"dubai-cares-conducts-a-field-visit-to-peru-to-monitor-the-progress-of-two-current-programs-targeting-social-inclusion-through-music-and-early-childhood-development","FormattedDate":"01 July 2019","VideoUrl":"","Date":"\/Date(1561924800000)\/","DetailImages":[{"Url":"https://www.almaktouminitiatives.org/images/default-source/default-album/c44a3942-min628f3401-0f6a-4b94-bed9-ef86a2a50768.jpg?sfvrsn=2149e2e7_3","AlternativeText":""},{"Url":"https://www.almaktouminitiatives.org/images/default-source/default-album/c44a1521-minab8bdbda-f140-436d-bce4-70bd588f2035.jpg?sfvrsn=c37d097b_3","AlternativeText":""}],"ThumbnailImage":{"Url":"https://www.almaktouminitiatives.org/images/default-source/default-album/c44a3942-min66820f49-23a3-4dd4-9a22-606f4b5158d2.jpg?sfvrsn=a0da204a_3","AlternativeText":""}},{"Id":"00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000","TypeId":"00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000","Title":"As part of MBRSG’s initiatives: Emirates Center for Government Knowledge Launches ‘Knowledge Gate’ Portal","Text":"\u003cp\u003eThe Emirates Center for Government Knowledge (ECGK), part of the Mohammed bin Rashid School of Government (MBRSG), has launched the ‘Knowledge Gate’, a unified smart portal.

Additionally, 6 women will be part of the 12-person leadership team that helps drive the project to completion. Reflecting one of the pillars of the Year of Tolerance to implement multicultural initiatives and projects, the volunteer group, consisting of diverse nationalities and professional backgrounds, worked together with the local community and combined their wide variety of skills to assist in all construction activities, while enjoying the unique opportunity of interacting with community members and discovering their culture, values and traditions.

Volunteers assist in various construction tasks such as digging, mixing concrete and making bricks, in complete cultural immersion with the local population.

Water scarcity affects over 40% of the world\u0027s population.\nDrinking water is one of the main foundations for achieving the UN Sustainable\nDevelopment Goals 2030, with the sixth goal being to ‘ensure access to water\nand sanitation for all.’ According to the United Nations World Water\nDevelopment Report 2019 titled ‘Leaving no one behind,’ 3 out of 10 people do\nnot have access to safe drinking water, and over 2 billion people live in\ncountries experiencing high water stress, and about 4 billion people experience\nsevere water scarcity during at least one month of the year. Stress levels will\ncontinue to increase as demand for water grows and the effects of climate\nchange intensify. Water-related diseases remain among the major causes of death in children under five; more than 800 children die every day from diseases\nlinked to poor hygiene. Hence the importance of the award, which bears the name\nof His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum who taught us that\n‘Challenges and obstacles are not the end of the road, but a pathway to new and\ncreative solutions’.
